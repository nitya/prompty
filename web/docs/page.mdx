## 1. Introduction

[Prompty](https://github.com/microsoft/prompty) is a _asset class_ providing a standardized format for LLM prompts that is designed to enhance observability, understandability, and portability for developers. Its primary goal is to streamline the developer workflow in _prompt engineering_ and _prompt source management_ across various languages and platforms.

Prompty currently supports popular runtimes such as Python and C#, and frameworks like [LangChain](docs/tutorials/using-langchain) and [Semantic Kernel](/docs/tutorials/using-semantic-kernel), with more integrations currently under development. Prompty is an [open source](https://github.com/microsoft/prompty) project and we encourage community contributions to extend its usage to new runtimes and frameworks.
