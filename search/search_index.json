How Prompty assets work","text":"<p>The <code>.prompty</code> file is an example of a Prompty asset that respects the schema defined in the Prompty specification. The asset class is language-agnostic (not tied to any language or framework), using a markdown format with YAML to specify metadata (\"frontmatter\") and content (\"template\") for a single prompt-based interaction with a Large Language Model. By doing this, it unifies the prompt content and its execution context in a single asset package, making it easy for developers to rapidly iterate on prompts for prototyping.</p> <p>The frontmatter (metadata) is structured as YAML, and specifies the prompt inputs, outputs, and model configuration parameters - with optional sample data for testing. The content (template) forms the body of the asset and is a Jnja template that allows for dynamic data binding of variables from Prompty asset inputs. The ability to specify sample data for testing (as an inline object or an external filename) allows us to use Prompty to iteratively define the shape of the data required in complex flows at the granularity of single LLM calls. </p> <p>The asset is then activated by a Prompty runtime as follows: 1. The file asset is loaded, converting it into an executable function. 1. The asset is now rendered, using function parameters to fill in the template data. 1. The asset is then executed, invoking the configured model with the rendered template. The returned result can then be displayed to the caller (single node) or can be passed as the input to a different Prompty asset (chained flow) to support more complex orchestration.</p>"},{"location":"Prompty%20/Section-01/03/#6-how-models-are-configured","title":"6. How Models Are Configured","text":"<p>Prompty assets must be configured with a model that is the target for the prompt request. However, this configuration can happen at different levels, with a hierarchy that decides which value takes final precedence during execution.</p> <ol> <li>The Visual Studio Code environment defines a default configuration that you can view by clicking on the <code>Prompty default</code> tab in the bottom toolbar. If a Prompty asset does not specify an explicit model configuration, the invocation will use the default model.</li> <li>When we convert a Prompty asset to code, you may see a <code>prompty.json</code> file with a default configuration. This is equivalent to the Visual Studio Code default, but applied to the case when we execute the Prompty from code (vs. VS Code editor).</li> <li>The Prompty file can itself define model configuration in the frontmatter as seen in our example Prompty (see snippet below). When specified, this value will override other defaults. In our example asset (snippet below), the Prompty file explicitly defines model configuration properties, giving it precedence. Note also that property values can be specified as constants (<code>gpt-4</code>) or reference environment variables (<code>${env:AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT}</code>). The latter is the recommended approach, ensuring that secrets don't get checked into version control with asset file updates.</li> </ol> YAML<pre><code>model:\n  api: chat\n  configuration:\n    type: azure_openai\n    azure_endpoint: ${env:AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT}\n    azure_deployment: gpt-4\n  parameters:\n    max_tokens: 3000\n</code></pre> <p>Tip 1: Configure Model in VS Code. If you use the same model configuration repeatedly, or across multiple Prompty assets, consider setting it up as a named model in Visual Studio Code.To configure your model, navigate to and edit your <code>settings.json</code> file. You can edit this by navigating to <code>settings &gt; Extensions &gt; Prompty &gt; Edit in settings.json</code>. Update an existing named model (e.g., <code>default</code>) or create a new one. You can update this at user level (across your assets) or workspace level (across team assets). </p> <p>Tip 2: Use Azure Managed Identity. If you are using Azure OpenAI or Azure-managed models, opt for keyless authentication by logging into Azure Active Directory (from Prompty extension, once per session) and using that credential to authenticate with your Azure OpenAI model deployments. To trigger this authflow, leave the <code>api_key</code> property value empty in your model configuration.</p> <p>Tip 3: Use Environment Variables. As shown above, property values can be defined using environment variables in the format <code>${env:ENVAR_NAME}</code>. By default, the Visual Studio Code extension will look for a <code>.env</code> file in the root folder of the repository containing Prompty assets - create and update that file (and ensure it is .gitignore-d by default). If you use GitHub Codespaces, you can also store environment variables as Codespaces secrets that get automatically injected into the runtime at launch.</p>"},{"location":"Prompty%20/Section-01/03/#7-how-to-observe-output","title":"7.

This functionality is customizable and can be used to trace the execution of your prompts in a way that makes sense to you. Prompty has two default traces built in: <code>console_tracer</code> and <code>PromptyTracer</code>. The <code>console_tracer</code> writes the trace to the console, and the <code>PromptyTracer</code> writes the trace to a JSON file. You can also create your own tracer by creating your own hook.</p> Python<pre><code>import prompty\n# import invoker\nimport prompty.azure\nfrom prompty.tracer import trace, Tracer, console_tracer, PromptyTracer\n\n# add console tracer\nTracer.add(\"console\", console_tracer)\n\n# add PromptyTracer\njson_tracer = PromptyTracer(output_dir=\"path/to/output\")\nTracer.add(\"console\", json_tracer.tracer)\n\n# execute the prompt\nresponse = prompty.execute(\"path/to/prompty/file\")\n\nprint(response)\n</code></pre> <p>You can also bring your own tracer by your own tracing hook. The <code>console_tracer</code> is the simplest example of a tracer. It writes the trace to the console. This is what it looks like:</p> Python<pre><code>@contextlib.contextmanager\ndef console_tracer(name: str) -&gt; Iterator[Callable[[str, Any], None]]:\n    try:\n        print(f\"Starting {name}\")\n        yield lambda key, value: print(f\"{key}:\\n{json.dumps(value, indent=4)}\")\n    finally:\n        print(f\"Ending {name}\")\n</code></pre> <p>It uses a context manager to define the start and end of the trace so you can do whatever setup and teardown you need. The <code>yield</code> statement returns a function that you can use to write the trace. The <code>console_tracer</code> writes the trace to the console using the <code>print</code> function.</p> <p>The <code>PromptyTracer</code> is a more complex example of a tracer. This tracer manages its internal state using a full class. Here's an example of the class based approach that writes each function trace to a JSON file:</p> Python<pre><code>class SimplePromptyTracer:\n    def __init__(self, output_dir: str):\n        self.output_dir = output_dir\n        self.tracer = self._tracer\n\n    @contextlib.contextmanager\n    def tracer(self, name: str) -&gt; Iterator[Callable[[str, Any], None]]:\n        trace = {}\n        try:\n            yield lambda key, value: trace.update({key: value})\n        finally:\n            with open(os.path.join(self.output_dir, f\"{name}.json\"), \"w\") as f:\n                json.dump(trace, f, indent=4)\n</code></pre> <p>The tracing mechanism is supported for all of the prompty runtime internals and can be used to trace the execution of the prompt along with all of the paramters. There is also a <code>@trace</code> decorator that can be used to trace the execution of any function external to the runtime. This is provided as a facility to trace the execution of the prompt and whatever supporting code you have.</p> Python<pre><code>import prompty\n# import invoker\nimport prompty.azure\nfrom prompty.tracer import trace, Tracer, PromptyTracer\n\njson_tracer = PromptyTracer(output_dir=\"path/to/output\")\nTracer.add(\"PromptyTracer\", json_tracer.tracer)\n\n@trace\ndef get_customer(customerId):\n    return {\"id\": customerId, \"firstName\": \"Sally\", \"lastName\": \"Davis\"}\n\n@trace\ndef get_response(customerId, prompt):\n    customer = get_customer(customerId)\n\n    result = prompty.execute(\n        prompt,\n        inputs={\"question\": question, \"customer\": customer},\n    )\n    return {\"question\": question, \"answer\": result}\n</code></pre> <p>In this case, whenever this code is executed, a <code>.tracy</code> file will be created in the <code>path/to/output</code> directory. This file will contain the trace of the execution of the <code>get_response</code> function, the execution of the <code>get_customer</code> function, and the prompty internals that generated the response.</p>"},{"location":"Prompty%20/Section-04/04/#opentelemetry-tracing","title":"OpenTelemetry Tracing","text":"<p>You can add OpenTelemetry tracing to your application using the same hook mechanism.

It has regained some popularity recently in low-voltage tracks, which often look nothing like their predecessors because they do not have the safety issues that line-voltage systems have, and are therefore less bulky and more ornamental in themselves. A master transformer feeds all of the fixtures on the track or rod with 12 or 24 volts, instead of each light fixture having its own line-to-low voltage transformer. There are traditional spots and floods, as well as other small hanging fixtures. A modified version of this is cable lighting, where lights are hung from or clipped to bare metal cables under tension\n  answer: The main transformer is the object that feeds all the fixtures in low voltage tracks.\n---\n\nsystem:\nYou are an AI assistant.
