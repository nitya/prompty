# Sandbox

## About

This is a sandbox for exploring _Prompty Cookbook_ content that reflects familiar developer journeys or asks. Some cookbook examples that reflect desired best practices:

| Cookbook | Description |
|:---|:---|
| [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/) | These **How-to Guides** are _Goal oriented and concrete_ as opposed to [conceptual guides](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/) that are _explanation-driven_. We need to be more "how-to" than "what-is" |
| [OpenAI](https://cookbook.openai.com/) | These combine **How-to** with **Intro-to** content. But _filter tags_ are worth tracking - e.g., response, embeddings, completions, whisper, dall-e, vision, functions, assistants, chat, fine-tuning etc. |
| [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/learn/cookbook/index) | These illustrate practical aspects of building AI apps - and have _open-source_ in focus. Recipes grouped into: MLOps, LLM, Vision, Diffusion, Multimodal, Search, Agents. |
| [Phi Cookbook](https://github.com/microsoft/PhiCookBook) | These provide a comprehensive list of sample scenarios with one model family in mind. Since Prompty should work with Phi out of the box, inspiration for "How-to XYZ with Prompty" |

## Format 

Ideally, each cookbook _recipe_ should adopt this narrative, with relevant sections:

- Recipe Title: _What are we making?_
- Ingredients: _What are the pre-requisites?_
- Process: _How to make this, step-by-step_
- Outcome: _Show example of result_ (screenshot, video, repo)
- Tips & Tricks: _Share any guidance for troubleshooting, best practices_.

## Table Of Contents

This section will be updated with links as we author and test articles for the cookbook.
