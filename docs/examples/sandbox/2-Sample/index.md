## Example With OpenAI

This is an example of the most basic Prompty asset for invoking an openAI model for chat completions. The starting Prompty asset (iteration 0) is in `01-basic-openai.prompty`. Let's iterate on this in steps, to understand how to configure various parameters for the chat completion step.

### Setup Environment

For convenience:

- Create a `.env` file in the repository with an `OPENAI_API_KEY=` line
- Set the value to the `sk-proj...` API_KEY value from OpenAI.
- Install the Prompty VS Code Extension
- Open the Prompty asset in editor, click _Play_ icon (F5)

You should see the VS Code Terminal switch to the _Output_ tab to show results. 

- Keep the tab open and iterate on the asset in the editor
- Click _Play_ to execute revised asset
- This is the basic flow for prompt engineering with Prompty

### S0: Basic Prompt

Execute the basic asset. This just validates our setup (with the API key) and helps setup the basic scaffold for a working asset. This is what we see in frontmatter (metadata):

1. The `sample` data provides the default `question` input for the run.
1. The `model` configuration specifies the provider type and deployment name
1. The `api_key` for configuration is read from the `.env` environment variable

This is what we see in the content (template):

1. The `system` section lets you define system messages for the execution
1. The `user` section identifies the initial user question
1. The space in between can be updated with more _context_ sections as needed.

### S1: Configure Parameters

Try configuring model parameters and observing impact on generated prompt responses. For example, you can explore the impact of *max_tokens*:

1. Try switching "max_tokens" between 100 and 1000
1. Observe how truncated output (100) is now completed (1000).

Try adding new context sections that can be bound to input data (currently inline). For example, you can now provide placeholders for the user name, and use those as variables when guiding model response. _Variable values are filled in from sample by default, unless CLI or code invoked_.

### S2: Specify Tools

For this exercise, you will need to have a [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) account - the free version will do! 

- Create an account and [look up the api key](https://www.weatherapi.com/my/)
- Save that to the `.env` file as the value for `WEATHER_API_KEY=` 
- Modify the prompty asset, and run it.

### S3: Import Files

<!--
#codebase use the Prompty.yaml specification as reference and create a Prompty asset that can invoke an OpenAI vision model with an image loaded from the local filesystem
-->

Steps to Use:

 - Prepare the Environment: Ensure the .env file contains OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>.
 - Place the Image: Save the image you want to analyze in the ./assets/ directory with the name sample_image.jpg.
 - Run the Asset: Use the Prompty CLI or VS Code extension to execute the asset.
